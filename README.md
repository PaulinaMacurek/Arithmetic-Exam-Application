# Arithmetic-Exam-Application
Project made as part of the Python Core course at Jet Brains Academy

## About
Many people are fond of interactive learning. In this project, you will learn how to write an application that can facilitate solving arithmetic operations in a quick manner. 
The application will generate a mathematical expression for a user to solve. 
Implement various levels of difficulty and let the application save the results and show the progress of learning.

## Learning outcomes
Learn how to handle input and output, employ the random number generator, and write the output to a file.

## Stages:
### :ballot_box_with_check:Stage 1/4: Mini-calculator
Write a mini calculator to work with numbers and simple mathematical operations. 
### :ballot_box_with_check:Stage 2/4: Task generator
Use the random number generator to make your tasks random. 
### :ballot_box_with_check:Stage 3/4: More tasks needed!
Test with one question is boring, let's add more questions! Also, we need to find a way to handle user typos.. 
### :ballot_box_with_check:Stage 4/4: Adding marks
Solving mathematical expressions is helpful, but many students prefer to get marks. Let's add marks and save the results!
